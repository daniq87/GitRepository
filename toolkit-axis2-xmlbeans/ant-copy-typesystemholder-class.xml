<!--
    This script copies missing TypeSystemHolder.class files together with their
    package structure from ${project.basedir}/target/generated-sources/stubs
    to ${project.basedir}/target/classes, so they are in classpath.

    This is due to a known and reported, but not yet fixed bug in
    axis2-wsdl2code-maven-plugin maven plugin.
