            ADB data binding framework is intended to be rather simple and lightweight. It provides means to compile XML schemas and WSDL files into java classes.
            Use of this tool is pretty straightforward, but working with generated files may be cumbersome.

        <p>
            ADB data binding is generally available through the <span class="code">WSDL2Java</span> tool, by specifying proper databinding option, as described
            in Axis2 section <!-- TODO: add link -->.

            As Sabre Web Services definitions (provided in the form of WSDL files) use corresponding types of data structures, proper XML Schema files must be provided in same location as the WSDL file.
            It includes common schemas for SOAP communication protocol (available as Common Schemas asset at <a href="https://drc.sabre.com/">https://drc.sabre.com/</a> ) and request/response object pairs definition
            (available also at <a href="https://drc.sabre.com/">https://drc.sabre.com/</a> as asset for each service or at
            <a href="http://developer.sabre.com">http://developer.sabre.com</a>).

        <p>
            If all of the required files are available for code generation tool, after invocation it will by default generate one
            stub java class per service.
            The file will be placed in proper folder structure, according to specified output package and directory.
            The file will be named <span class="code"> &lt;serviceName&gt;ServiceStub.java </span>
            The stub will contain static inner classes for each complex type. Any element or attribute encapsulated by this complex type
            will become a field in that class. Simple types restrictions are handled by replacing the relevant type with the basetype.
            Generated classes follow the bean convention, with <span class="code">setAttribute</span> and
            <span class="code">getAttribute</span> methods for object fields and
            <span class="code">addElement(Element e)</span> or <span class="code">setElements(Element [] e)</span> for arrays.

        <p>
            Beacuse all used structures are compiled into a stub class as static innter classes, the generated
            files may be quite large (up to hundreds of thousands of lines, depending on service definition
            complexity ) and therefore problematic to work with, for example some IDE settings changes may be necessary. <br />
            What is more, ADB does not handle optional attributes in schema definitions well. In generated SOAP messages optional
            attributes are always present, with values set to their defaults, which may not be desired behavior. In particular cases
            optional attributes may be mutually exclusive and sending request containing them to server may cause the server
            to respond with Fault message. <br />
            Therefore it might not be possible to use automatically generated code without modificating it manually. <br /><br />
            Nevertheless, using ADB causes significant code redundancy in project. The reason is the fact that all binding inner
            classes are generated per service. So there is one inner class for eb:MessageHeader xml object and one for wsse:Security
            in each service, even though the structure of these classes is identical, as they reflect the same source xml structure.
            For each service request an object of those classes must be assembled. So either a separate header-creating method must
            be implemented for each service stub causing code repetition, or a header factory method using reflection
            and generic return type may be introduced, which would be difficult and error-prone. <br/><br />
            Because of the facts mentioned above, <span class="warning">ADB is not a recommended databinding framework
            for working with Sabre Web Services.</span>

    <!-- XMLBeans -->

        <p>
            XMLBeans is another data binding framework for Java. It also is available via <span class="code">wsdl2code</span> maven plugin.
            In this case, classes are not generated per service, but rather per namespace. It eliminates the code duplication problem,
            causing code to be clearer and easier to use. <br />
            However, XMLBeans framework has another significant problem, which may cause it impossible to use with some of the
            Sabre Web Services (described in separate section). One should keep that in mind when deciding to use XMLBeans,
            because at some point being unable to consume specific Sabre Web Service may block development of whole application.
        </p>

        <!-- Using -->
        <a name="xmlbeans-using-anchor"></a>
        <span class="bold"> Using </span><br/>
        <p>
            Just like ADB, XMLBeans data binding is available in Axis2 via <span class="code">WSDL2Java</span> command line tool
            or <span class="code">wsdl2code</span> Maven plugin. They both provide same functionality and require similar
            configuration.
        </p>

        <!-- Execution requirements -->

        <span class="bold"> Execution requirements </span><br/>
        <p>
            As XMLBeans framework is invoked as part of Axis2 client generation, for data binding purposes, the flow is similar to
            the one described in ADB section. The main (and in most cases, the only) change would be to change the data binding option
            (the <span class="code">-d xmlbeans</span> command line option or
            <span class="code">&lt;databindingName&gt;xmlbeans&lt;/databindingName&gt;</span> in Maven configuration).
            Any additional files referenced from WSDL file must reside with it in it's directory.
        </p>

        <!-- Generated Code -->
        <a name="xmlbeans-generated-code-anchor"></a>
        <span class="bold"> Generated code </span><br/>
        <p>
            XMLBeans will generate one stub class per service (one stub class per one WSDL file). That stub will encapsulate
            methods for invoking service calls defined in WSDL file. Unlike ADB, XMLBeans will generate classes per
            XML structure namespace, which means one class for <span class="code">eb:MessageHeader</span> and
            one class for <span class="code">wsse:Security</span>. Creating these objects can be done globally and the
            proper factory method may be reused in every service. <br /><br />

            The structure of generated classes will mirror the structure of XSD schema definition. Each nested type
            in schema will cause the creation of corresponding nested Java Interface. That will cause problem described in the next section.
            <br /><br />

            Generated interfaces will be placed in a package whose name will reflect the target namespace of schema definition.
            The general rules for converting namespace to package name can be obtained from
            <a href="http://xmlbeans.apache.org/docs/2.0.0/guide/conJavaTypesGeneratedFromUserDerived.html">XMLBeans documentation</a>.<br /><br />

            XMLBeans maps schema types into JavaBeans-style classes. This means the presence of typical setter/getter methods, such as
            <span class="code">void setElement(ElementType element)</span> and <span class="code">ElementType getElement()</span>.
            One useful thing is also a <span class="code">ElementType addNewElement()</span> method, that creates new element, places
            it in the object in which it was invoked and returns it allowing further modification and processing. <br /> <br />

            One can learn about using XMLBeans at <a href="http://xmlbeans.apache.org/documentation/index.html">XMLBeans Project's website</a>
        </p>

        <!-- Known Issues -->
        <a name="xmlbeans-known-issues-anchor"></a>
        <span class="bold"> Known issues </span><br/>
        <p>
            Although using XMLBeans data binding results in more clear and easy-to-use code, it has a serious issue,
            which cause it almost impossible to use with some of the Sabre Web Services. <br /> <br />

            To reflect the structure of XML Schema Definition, XMLBeans creates a series of nested interfaces.
            Each nested type will have a corresponding nested interface. The problem is, that at compile time the Java compiler
            creates separate <span class="code">.class</span> file for each class or interface. Nested classes will be compiled
            to a file whose name will be composed of the name of the outer class, concatenated with the name of the inner class
            with the dollar symbol ('$'). Classes nested in inner classes will be compiled to a file whose name will be composed of the
            names of all classes which are higher in the hierarchy, like
            <span class="code">OuterClass$InnerClass1$InnerClass2$...$InnerClass10$InnerClass11.class</span>.
            When generating classes from a complex schema with deeply nested types, generated class's name may exceed the 255
            characters limit imposed by most of the modern filesystems, used in both Windows and Unix-like systems
            (this limit is present in all of the following file systems: NTFS, FAT32, exFAT, ext3, ext4 and ZFS). This will
            make such nested class/interface impossible to compile, as the Java compiler will not be able to save compiled
            file on disk. There is no possibility to use any custom binding or change XMLBeans behavior in way that would
            allow generating Java stubs from deeply nested schemas. Therefore it is not possible to use XMLBeans with some of
            the Sabre Web Services, that contain deeply nested schemas (e.g. EnhancedAirBook, PassengerDetailsRQ, TravelItineraryLLSRQ),
            when using any common file system. On the other hand, changing operating system or switching to niche filesystem
            just to use one particular XML binding framework (while there are many others) seems to be an exaggeration. <br /><br />

            For the record, it should be mentioned that there is actually a way to use XMLBeans on any common filesystem
            and avoid long file names issue. However, it is a workaround that requires developing specialized tools,
            like custom compilers or Maven plugins, that should be next incorporated into application build process.
            The trick is, that JVM itself does not preserve the 255 characters identifier length limit (it uses
            it's own 65535 characters limit), so the only problem is a intermediate step of storing .class file on disk
            between compiling and loading class by a classloader. Therefore, avoiding this step, would solve the problem.
            There are at least two possible ways to do that. They both make use of the <span class="code">javax.tools</span>
            package. The first way is to create a custom dynamic in-memory java compiler, that would load a source code file
            from the disk, compile it in-memory and then provide means of instantiating object of compiled class via
            customized in-memory classloader. Another way is to compile problematic source code in-memory and redirect the output
            to byte arrays, which then would be used to create a JAR containing created classes. That way the storing phase would
            be omitted, as the only file written to filesystem would be the JAR, which holds no name limitations. <br />
            Although those ways seem to solve the problem (they were not tested), once again, creaing custom compilers
            and classloaders does not seem to be an adequate way of solving a problem caused by wrong choice of
            data binding framework for web services application.<br/><br />

            JAXB data binding is a powerful tool with good customization capabilities, due to custom bindings mechanism.
            Thanks to that, if default behavior causes any problems, it may be easily changed. JAXB is a commercial standard

        <p>
            Just like with two former data bindings, the main and only requirement is to provide all necessary files and
            their directories. In this case, along with schema and WSDL files, custom bindings (in form of .jxb files) should
            be delivered. <br /><br />

            Some of Sabre Web services will require specyfing custom JAXB binding file during schema compilation. This is
            because some schemas contain nested types with the same name as one of outer elements. JAXB compiles each
            complex type into a public static inner class and there cannot be two such classes with the same name.
            However, this may solved easily. The custom binding file has a form of a XML file (although the file
            extension may be different, like *.jxb, to emphasize it's function) and the following structure:

        <span class="bold"> Generated code </span><br/>
        <p>
            By default, JAXB will generate classes <span class="italic">per namespace</span>, mapping <span class="code">targetNamespace</span>
            attribute from schema to package name. For example, type <span class="code">PassengerDetailsRQ</span>, defined in
            <span class="code">http://webservices.sabre.com/sabreXML/2011/10</span> target namespace will be compiled (with
            default settings) to <span class="code">com.sabre.webservices.sabrexml._2011._10.PassengerDetailsRQ</span> class.
            This means no classes duplication and ability to reuse code throughout the application. JAXB generates nested public
            static classes to reflect the structure of a schema. Bindings of nodes and package names may be customized using binding files
            (<a href="https://jaxb.java.net/guide/Customizing_Java_packages.html">here</a> are hints about package naming customization). <br /><br />

            The classes will be annotated with JAXB annotations, which means they may be reused by any other JAX-WS implementation.
            Because it is a widely used standard, it makes the code more generic, reusable and less tightly-coupled

        <span class="bold"> Overview </span><br/>
        <p>

            Apache Axis2 is a Java framework for working with WebServices, SOAP and WSDL. It provides means to create, send, receive and handle
            SOAP messages to and from web services. <br />
            Axis2 Engine has two main functionalities:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Providing services as a web services server</li>
                <li>Consuimng services from server as a web services client</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            The use of both is similar - one should provide Axis2 with web services description in form of WSDL files,
            and it will produce corresponding java code. When generating clients, the framework will produce service stubs.
            Generated stubs will contain two major components:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Static inner classes for each complex type defined in corresponding XSD file </li>
                <li>Methods to invoke web services calls (one method per each binding defined in WSDL file) </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            When generating services stubs, Axis2 will take a WSDL file (with all related XSD files) and respond with appropriate
            structure of directories and classes. The next step is to fill generated classes' methods with business-logic code to provide
            desired functionality for services. Among generated files there will be a Ant <span class="code" >build.xml</span> file. When invoked on that
            file, Ant will compile all sources and pack them into a WAR archive, ready to deploy into a web server, such as Tomcat.
        </p>

        <!-- Using Framework -->
        <a name="axis2-using-anchor"></a>
        <span class="bold"> Using </span><br/>
        <p>
            Axis2 may be used either as stand-alone command line tool or as a Maven plugin. When using Axis2 from command line,
            user must specify <span class="code">AXIS2_HOME</span> home variable, pointing to the location of Axis2 directory.
            Appending <span class="code">$AXIS2_HOME/bin</span> (or <span class="code">%AXIS2_HOME%\bin</span> under Windows)
            to <span class="code">PATH</span> system variable will allow to run Axis2-related scripts easily. <br /><br />
            Using Axis2 as Maven dependency will be no surprise for Maven users. For information about versioning and
            dependencies, see <a href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.axis2">Maven repository site</a>.

                <li>Receiving and handling the response</li>
            </ol>

        <!-- Details of client development -->
        <a name="axis2-developing-client-anchor"></a>
        <span class="bold"> Developing client in detail </span><br/>
        <p>
            Client generation is accomplished through invoking <span class="code">wsdl2java</span> tool. <br />
        </p>
            <span class="code">wsdl2java</span> may be accessed in various ways:
            <ul>
                <li>As stand-alone command line tool</li>
                <li>As Ant task</li>
                <li>As maven plugin</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Usage of all of the above is similar. It requires specifying location of the WSDL and XML Schema files, output location for
            the generated sources and package name for generated classes. Unless told differently, ADB generates one big stub class
            per one web service definition (or, alternatively, one stub java class per one WSDL file). Parameters are passed as
            command line options when running from command line. In case of invoking via Ant or Maven tool they are specified in adequate
            XML file (build.xml or pom.xml). <br /><br />

            Generating clients via command line tool is done by executing the following script: <br /><br/>

            <span class="code">
            $AXIS2_HOME/bin/wsdl2java.sh -uri &lt;path_to_.wsdl_file&gt; -p &lt;output_package_name&gt; -d &lt;data_binding_framework&gt; -o &lt;output_directory&gt; <br /><br />
            </span>

            As one could expect, executing the above generates client's side services stubs for services described in the WSDL file,
            path to which is provided after <span class="code">-uri</span> option. Classes are generated into specified
            output directory (<span class="code">-o</span> option) under specified package (<span class="code">-p</span>).
            Proper data binding framework is used (<span class="code">-d</span>).
            The command line tool is documented in detail <a href="http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/docs/reference.html">HERE</a>.
            <br /><br />

            </ul>


        <p>Handlers</p>

        <p>
            Handlers are classes that extend the <span class="code" >org.apache.axis2.handlers.AbstractHandler</span> class.
            A handler must extends that abstract class and implement
            <span class="code">public&nbsp;Handler.InvocationResponse&nbsp;invoke(MessageContext&nbsp;msgContext)&nbsp;throws&nbsp;AxisFault</span>
            method. Per each message in specified scope, this method will be invoked with the corresponding <span class="code">MessageContext</span>
            object as a parameter. <br />
            Specifying a proper set of handlers is generally advised. The handlers will form the first line of error detection and
            processing system. Error handlers should check if the response from the server contains any
            <span class="code">&lt;Fault&gt;</span> or <span class="code">&lt;Error&gt;</span> elements and if so, they should prevent
            it from being processed. Any additional message check can be performed. After ensuring the message is valid,
            the normal content processing flow may be continued.
            <br /><br />
            There is a situation when specifying a handler is mandatory. It is when a message going in or out
            contains a <span class="code">mustUnderstand="1"</span> attribute value. Each such message must be handled in the proper way,
            or <span class="code">org.apache.axis2.AxisFault</span> will be thrown. To avoid this and ensure correct
            <span class="code">mustUnderstand="1"</span> handling, the following step must be taken:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The <span class="code">setProcessed()</span> method must be invoked on each of the <span class="code">SOAPHeaderBlock</span>
                members of the <span class="code">SOAPHeader</span> element of the current context.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The example flow may look something like this:
        </p>
        <p class="snippet">
            SOAPHeader header = msgContext.getEnvelope().getHeader(); <br />
            Iterator headerBlocksIterator = header.getHeadersToProcess(null); <br /><br />
            while( headerBlocksIterator.hasNext() ) { <br />
            &emsp;&emsp;SOAPHeaderBlock headerBlock = (SOAPHeaderBlock) headerBlocksIterator.next(); <br />
            &emsp;&emsp;// process header block <br />
            &emsp;&emsp;headerBlock.setProcessed();<br />
            }<br />
        </p>

        <p>

            Apache CXF is another framework designed strictly for the purpose of working with web services.
            In general, it provides same functionality as Axis2, which means the ability to send, process and receive messages,
            both to and from services. Similarly, CXF allows user to develop both client and server side application.
            It uses contract-first approach, which means creation of service implementation code based on service definition
            (in form ow WSDL files and schema definition). What it means for Sabre Web Services consumer, is that Java client
            code can be generated easily based on WSDL and XSD files, available on
            <a href="http://developer.sabre.com">Sabre Developer's Site</a>.
            <br />
            Client code will consist of classes similar to service stubs in Axis2, Services and PortTypes, allowing
            user to invoke services calls, and accompanying binding classes representing types defined in schemas.
            Developer's role is to construct an object representing request to be invoked, pass it to a method representing
            service call, and then to process the response.

        <ul>
            <li>As command line tool</li>

        <p>
            Using CXF to consume web services is generally no different than using Axis2:

            </ol>



        <!-- Details of client development -->
        <a name="cxf-developing-client-anchor"></a>
        <span class="bold"> Developing client in detail </span><br/>
        <p>
            Client development starts with collecting services definitions and schema definitions (WSDL and XSD) files.
            They are available for Sabre clients on web. Note, that code generation tool expect all the necessary schemas
            to be present in the same directory as WSDL file. So be sure to place there not only the service specific files,
            but also those available as "Common Schemas" asset (they are needed to create SOAP envelope and message correctly).
            <br /><br />
            When required files are gathered, <span class="code">wsdl2java</span> tool can be used to generate client code.
            Check documentation mentioned before for details on how to use this tool.
            <br /><br />
            On this stage, developer must decide which data binding framework to use for client code generation. The recommended
            one is JAXB, as it is quite easy to use and elastic, yet powerful. The ADB and XMLBeans frameworks have disadvantages
            described in previous sections. However, the proper use of JAXB data binding requires taking additional steps
            (creating custom binding files), as described in next section. However, this is not difficult thing to do.
            <br /><br />
            The next step is to create a client, which will utilize generated classes to access web services.
            This process requires a bit of knowledge how the CXF framework works. This will be covered here briefly. To see
            a full working example, please refer to the !!!sample project, provided by Sabre Web Services Team (toolkit-cxf-jaxb module).
            <br /><br />
            CXF generates two main classes for each service defined in WSDL file:
            <span class="code">&lt;ServiceName&gt;Service extends javax.xml.ws.Service</span> and
            <span class="code">&lt;ServiceName&gt;PortType</span>.
            <br /><br />
            The first one provides two useful components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Default constructor - creates service class, based on information contained in WSDL file at the time
                of generating this class (assumes, that WSDL file is still available in the same location)</li>
            <li><span class="code">get_PortName_()</span> method - returns a class associated with specific
                port defined in service. This class maps each operation defined in the WSDL file to a corresponding method,
                whose invokation is equivalent to a web service call.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            So, based on !!!sample project, the invokation of Sabre's OTA_AirAvailLLSRQ would look something like this:
            <br /><br />
            <span class="code">
            &emsp;&emsp;OTAAirAvailService service = new OTAAirAvailService(); <br />
            &emsp;&emsp;OTAAirAvailPortType port = service.getOTAAirAvailPortType(); <br />
            &emsp;&emsp;OTAAirAvailRS serviceResponse = port.otaAirAvail(...); // set correct arguments <br />
            </span>
            <br />

            After implementing logic to create requests and handle respones, one must define interceptors for services. Interceptors
            are necessary to get access to full SOAP envelope. Invoking methods on port class allows only to see response body,
            which is not enough information to successfully consume Sabre Web Services. Typically, one has to access the
            data in SOAP header, like <span class="code">&lt;eb:MessageHeader&gt;</span>
            (<span class="code">eb:Action</span> element, to check if the message contains correct or error response)
            and <span class="code">&lt;wsse:Security&gt;</span> (to obtain binary security token during session creation).
            Interceptors allow exactly to do that.
            <br/>
            In the !!!sample project, interceptor classes are derived from
            <span class="code">org.apache.cxf.binding.soap.interceptor.AbstractSoapInterceptor</span> class, which
            provides means of accessing full SOAP message via <span class="code">handleMessage(SoapMessage message)</span> method.
            It is possible to get full information from SOAP message as stream, however, this will leave the message empty.
            To avoid error on further processing, data must be copied and placed back into the message
            (see <span class="code">LLSErrorInterceptor</span> class from
            <span class="code">com.sabre.sws.tools.wsdl.cxf.jaxb.interceptors</span> package in
            <span class="code">toolkit-cxf-jaxb</span> module in !!!sample project).
            Interceptor must be placed in a correct phase, so that the expected data is present in the message as it is being processed.
            For the detailed information about phases and interceptor chains, please refer to the
            <a href="http://cxf.apache.org/docs/interceptors.html"> CXF's documentation</a>.
            <br /><br />
            Note one important thing - by default, port class will use the endpoint URL specified in WSDL file, from which
            it was created. However, this could be highly undesirable, especially during the development and testing phase,
            as this would be <span class="code">https://webservices.sabre.com/websvc</span> - it's a production endpoint and
            performing any operations on it may generate charges on customer's account and decrement real-time inventory.
            During development, one would probably use Sabre test system or even mocked service. To change endpoint URL
            used by your service's client, please do as following (or see one of classes in
            <span class="code">com.sabre.sws.tools.wsdl.cxf.jaxb.wrappers</span> package in !!!sample project):
            <br /><br />

            <span class="code">
            &emsp;&emsp;String endpointURL = "http://some.test.url/svc"; <br />
            &emsp;&emsp;OTAAirAvailService service = new OTAAirAvailService(); <br />
            &emsp;&emsp;OTAAirAvailPortType port = service.getOTAAirAvailPortType(); <br />
            &emsp;&emsp;BindingProvider bindingProvider = (BindingProvider) port;<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;bindingProvider.getRequestContext().put(BindingProvider.ENDPOINT_ADDRESS_PROPERTY, endpointURL);<br />
            </span>

            <br /><br />
            After all these steps are taken, one has to create a valid request object and pass it to port's method corresponding
            to the desired service, along with proper header holders (as in the !!!sample project).
            The method will return response object, which may be further processed to extract required information from it.

        <span class="bold"> Overview </span><br/>
        <p>
            Spring Web Services (Spring WS) is part of the Spring Framework responsible for working with web services.
            It benefits from that fact in many ways, simplifying and automating many things. However, Spring WS has a bit
            different approach to building web services than previously described frameworks - it works on lower level,
            exposing to user things, that they do behind the scenes. It gives more control over the process to the developer,
            but requires more effort.
            <br /><br />
            Spring WS also uses <span class="italic">contract-first </span> approach, so user is encouraged to develop client code
            based on existing service definition. Main difference is, that Spring WS handles marshalling and sending of a single object
            well, but requires more effort to compose the message consisting of multiple elements. This will be covered in following
            section, and the full working implementation may be seen in !!!sample project, at <span class="code">toolkit-spring-ws</span>
            module.
        </p>

        <span class="bold"> Using </span><br/>
        <p>
            Spring Web Services does not provide it's own code generation tool, so using it is just a matter of
            placing Spring WS jars in your classpath. This is easiest done via dependency management system, like Maven or Gradle.
            This also means, that user has to take care of compiling schemas to java classes him or herself. Since it is assumed
            that system like Maven is being used, the easiest way is to utilize one of binding plugins. Two examples of JAXB Maven
            plugins are listed in previous section.
        </p>

        <!-- Details of client development -->
        <a name="springws-developing-client-anchor"></a>
        <span class="bold"> Developing client in detail </span><br/>
        <p>
            When using Spring WS, only schema definitions are required, for developer takes care of creating the message.
            In fact, the minimal set of schemas required to consume Sabre Web Services consists of request and response
            definitions for each service and schemas of security and message headers to build the envelope.
            <br />
            These files should be then compiled to Java classes. !!!sample project uses JAXB2 Maven plugin to achieve this.
            Spring WS provides one main class to send and receive web services message: <span class="code">WebServiceTemplate</span>,
            which resides in <span class="code">org.springframework.ws.client.core</span> package.
            This class contains many methods to invoke web services calls. Two most important of them are
            <span class="code">sendSourceAndReceiveToResult(...)</span> and <span class="code">marshallSendAndReceive(...)</span>.
            The former takes two parameters: <span class="code">javax.xml.transform.Source</span>, from which it reads
            the request to send, and <span class="code">javax.xml.transform.Result</span>, to which it writes the response.
            The latter allows working with POJO's and hides the details of marshalling and unmarshalling from the developer.
            It returns <span class="code">Object</span> type and takes one object as a parameter. Before calling this
            method, developer must configure the <span class="code">WebServiceTemplate</span> object by setting
            marshaller and unmarshaller and specifying web service's URI. URI may be set during constructing of an object
            through the constructor argument or set anytime before web service call via <span class="code">WebServiceTemplate</span>'s
            <span class="code">setDefaultUri(String uri)</span> method. The easiest way of providing marshaller and
            unmarshaller is to use Spring OXM's <span class="code">org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller</span> class'
            object. It implements both <span class="code">Marshaller</span> and <span class="code">Unmarshaller</span>
            interfaces and is capable of marshalling and unmarshalling objects of classes that are generated via JAXB
            (and therefore annotated with proper JAX-WS annotations). <span class="code">Jaxb2Marshaller</span>
            must be supplied with a <span class="code">contextPath</span> - a <span class="code">String</span> containing
            colon-separated packages names with classes to marshall. <br/><br/>

            After such configuration one can call <span class="code">marshallSendAndReceive(...)</span>. It then will
            marshall the parameter object, put it into the message, send the message to the URI specified, obtain
            the response, unmarshall it and return resulting object as method return value. <br/><br/>

            It is also possible to use Spring's convenience class
            <span class="code">org.springframework.ws.client.core.support.WebServiceGatewaySupport</span>, which encapsulates
            <span class="code">WebServiceTemplate</span> and exposes convenient bean properties to enable easy configuration.
            However, this is not mandatory. <br /><br />

            </ul>

        <p>
            Callbacks <br/><br/>

            Callbacks mechanism allows developer to manipulate the message content after it was created, but before it is
            send. Send methods described above have overloaded versions that take one Callback
            parameter. Since Spring WS leaves construction of a message to the developer, it is a good point to
            add all necessary headers into SOAP message. Sabre Web Services require two custom headers:
            <span class="code">eb:MessageHeader</span> and <span class="code">wsse:Security</span>.
            They can be easily inserted in SOAP Envelope using callback. Callback must implement <span class="code">
            org.springframework.ws.client.core.WebServiceMessageCallback</span> interface and thus implement
            <span class="code">void doWithMessage(WebServiceMessage webServiceMessage)</span> method.
            The snippet below shows how to use this to compose correct message to work with Sabre Web Services:
        </p>

        <p class="snippet">
            public class HeaderComposingCallback implements WebServiceMessageCallback { <br />
            &emsp;@Override <br />
            &emsp;public void doWithMessage(WebServiceMessage webServiceMessage) throws IOException, TransformerException {<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;MessageHeader header = ... // get MessageHeader object<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Security security = ... // get Security object<br /><br />

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;builder.append(header.getClass().getPackage().getName()).append(":");<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;builder.append(security.getClass().getPackage().getName());<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Jaxb2Marshaller marshaller = new Jaxb2Marshaller();<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;marshaller.setContextPath(builder.toString());<br /><br/>

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;SoapHeader soapHeader = ((SoapMessage)webServiceMessage).getSoapHeader();<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;marshaller.marshal(header, soapHeader.getResult());<br />
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;marshaller.marshal(security, soapHeader.getResult());<br />
            &emsp;}<br />
            }<br />
        </p>

        <p>
            The !!!sample project uses this approach to create SOAP envelope and invoke Sabre Web Services.
        </p>

        <p>
            Interceptors
        </p>

        <p>
            Spring Web Services provides also the interceptors mechanism. Using interceptors one may gain access
            to <span class="code">MessageContext</span> object, which contains information about request and
            response messages, message exchange properties, endpoint and other useful data. As the interceptor
            allows to handle response message, it is a good mean of obtaining header information from it.
            In !!!sample project this capability is utilized to retrieve session token from SessionCreateRQ
            service's response. <br/><br />
            Interceptor must implement <span class="code">org.springframework.ws.client.support.interceptor.ClientInterceptor</span>
            interface with four methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">public boolean handleRequest(MessageContext messageContext)</span> </li>
            <li><span class="code">public boolean handleResponse(MessageContext messageContext)</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">public boolean handleFault(MessageContext messageContext)</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">public void afterCompletion(MessageContext messageContext, Exception e)</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The <span class="code">handleResponse</span> method may be used to retrieve token from message.
            It can be done by retrieving response from <span class="code">MessageContext</span>, then
            getting <span class="code">Security</span> header from it, unmarhaling it into object and
            finally getting session token from it with getter method. The snippet below shows the outline of
            code that need to be placed in <span class="code">handleResponse(MessageContext messageContext)</span> method:
        </p>

        <p class="snippet">

            &emsp;SoapMessage message = (SoapMessage) messageContext.getResponse();<br />
            &emsp;Source securitySource = message.getSoapHeader().examineHeaderElements(securityQName).next().getSource();<br />
            &emsp;Source headerSource = message.getSoapHeader().examineHeaderElements(headerQName).next().getSource();<br />

            &emsp;Jaxb2Marshaller = ... // create marshaller as in example above<br />

            &emsp;Security security = (Security) marshaller.unmarshal(securitySource);<br />
            &emsp;MessageHeader header = (MessageHeader) marshaller.unmarshal(headerSource);<br /><br />
            &emsp;String token = security.getBinarySecurityToken();<br />
            &emsp;String conversationId = header.getConversationId();<br />
        </p>

        <p>
            To see a full working example of interceptor use, refer to !!!sample project, <span class="code">toolkit-spring-ws</span>
            module.

        <span class="bold"> Known issues </span><br/>
        <p>
            When using Spring beans configuration, one should make sure that all underlying resources
            are adjusted to it. This concerns mostly <span class="code">Jaxb2Marshaller</span> bean.
            When a bean of that class is configured, it will be injected into <span class="code">WebServiceTemplate</span>
            objects. In that case the marshaller bean must contain information about all used classes and packages.
            It means that all names and identifiers used in JAXB annotations have to be unique. To achieve that,
            code generation tool should be executed with care and may require extensive configuration
            to avoid names duplication (as Sabre Web Services schemas share many common data structures in every service).

        <p>
            The <span class="code">wsimport</span> tool generates JAX-WS portable artifacts (services,
            service endpoint interfaces, fault exceptions, JAXB generated value types). It is distributed with JDK
            (from version 6). Beacuse it implements JAX-WS specification, using it is similar to using other JAX-WS
            implementation - CXF.

        <span class="bold"> Using </span><br/>
        <p>
            Using <span class="code">wsimport</span> is very simple and in many cases it would require no additional
            configuration - it should run from command line on any machine with JDK 6 or newer installed.
            To check if it is available (assuming that <span class="code">JAVA_HOME\bin</span> is in
            <span class="code">PATH</span> system variable), just type <span class="code">wsimport -help</span>.
            The <span class="code">wsimport</span> help page should be displayed. It contains information on
            how to use this tool. <br /><br />

            The simplest use case is compiling WSDL service definition into JAXB-generated classes. To do that,
            just type: <br /><br />

            <span class="code">wsimport -keep -verbose path/to/wsdl/file.wsdl</span> <br /><br />

            This will compile all schemas into java classes and create JAX-WS service artifacts for each service
            defined in WSDL file. <br /><br />

            <span class="code">wsimport</span> is also available as Maven plugin. To utilize it in your project,
            add the following to your POM's plugin section: <br /><br />
        </p>

            (all service-specific and common schemas must be present in one directory).
            It will generate JAX-WS artifacts - JAXB classes (that represent data types used in messages being exchanged
            and are defined in schemas) and JAX-WS artifacts - service enpoint interfaces (SEIs) and services. Together
            they allow to make web service call. <br /><br />

            User may specify additional options during <span class="code">wsimport</span> execution.
            Most important options are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">-d &lt;directory&gt;&thinsp; </span>  - specifies output directory for generated files</li>
            <li><span class="code">-b &lt;path&gt;</span> - specifies path to JAXB custom binding files (one
            <span class="code">-b</span> option per one binding file)</li>
            <li><span class="code">-B &lt;jaxbOption&gt;</span> - options to pass to JAXB compiler </li>
            <li><span class="code">-keep</span> - keep generated sources</li>
            <li><span class="code">-p </span> specify the output package name (overrides namespace to package mapping
            and any package mapping defined in custom binding file)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The corresponding set of Maven options is:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">&lt;destDir&gt;</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">&lt;bindingFiles&gt;</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">&lt;xjcArgs&gt;</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">&lt;keep&gt;</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">&lt;packageName&gt;</span></li>
        </ul>
